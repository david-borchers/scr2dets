# SCR estimated survey area (and related stuff) for detection on at least 2 detectors

# Initially created by Stuart Burell in his short sojourn into Statistics

# Todo
1. Simulate half-normal detection data.
2. Delete detections only observed from a single detector.
3. Perform distance sampling with traditional esa computation.
4. Perform distance sampling with modified esa (see article).
5. Repeat 1-4 with various detector configurations and detection probabilities.
6. Compute, compare and plot bias for both methods.
